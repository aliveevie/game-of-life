# Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. It is a zero-player game that evolves based on its initial configuration and follows simple rules to create complex patterns. This project provides a visual representation of Conway's Game of Life using React.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/aliveevie/game-of-life.git.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd game-of-life`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

1. Start the development server: `npm start`
2. Open your web browser and visit: `http://localhost:3000`

## How to Play

1. Adjust the grid size and cell colors in `src/App.css`.
2. Click on individual cells to toggle their state (alive/dead).
3. Use the controls to start, pause, and reset the simulation.
4. Observe how different patterns evolve over generations.

## Patterns

Explore various patterns that you can create or load in the grid, such as gliders, pulsars, and more. Modify the initial grid setup in the code to see different patterns in action.
